## Hello! I am a **2nd year** *computer science student* at **UCSD**. Over the past two years I have taken various computer science courses but I am especially excited to take CSE110 for the practical experiences that I will be able to participate in! 

## Here is the order of **_CSE_ classes** I have taken:
1. CSE 11
2. CSE 12
3. CSE 15L
4. CSE 20
5. CSE 21
6. CSE 30
7. CSE 100R
8. CSE 105

## *But* here are some **CSE** classes I am taking currently: 
- CSE 101
- CSE 110
> I still have a lot of classes to take...

## Outside of my academics I have various hobbies!
> Do we share any?
- [ ] Gyming
- [ ] Volleyball
- [ ] Bowling

## Here is the procedure to use git and update a repository
